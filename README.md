# Potato-Leaf-disease-Classification using CNN


Abstract :
              Potato is one of the most widely consumed staple foods globally, ranking as the fourth most important crop. The demand for potatoes has surged significantly, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, potato diseases pose a major threat to both the quality and quantity of yields. Late detection and improper classification of these diseases can lead to severe damage to the crop. Fortunately, many potato plant diseases can be identified early through visual inspection of the leaves. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based system for classifying four common types of potato leaf diseases. By leveraging the VGG16 and VGG19 convolutional neural network architectures, we achieve precise and reliable classification. Our model demonstrates an impressive average accuracy of 99.65%, showcasing the effectiveness of deep neural networks for disease detection in potato plants. This approach holds significant promise for improving crop monitoring and management practices in agriculture

              I.	INTRODUCTION  :
                                     FOOD SECURITY AND IMPROVED NUTRITION ARE CRITICAL CHALLENGES FACING THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR GLOBALLY. POTATOES, A STAPLE FOOD IN MANY COUNTRIES, PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN ADDRESSING THESE NEEDS DUE TO THEIR NUTRITIONAL RICHNESS. THEY ARE PARTICULARLY HIGH IN ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS SUCH AS VITAMINS C AND B6, POTASSIUM, MAGNESIUM, AND IRON. GLOBALLY, POTATOES RANK AS THE FOURTH MOST CONSUMED VEGETABLE CROP, WITH INDONESIA EMERGING AS ONE OF THE LARGEST POTATO PRODUCERS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. OVER THE PAST DECADE, INDONESIAâ€™S POTATO PRODUCTION HAS SEEN RAPID GROWTH, PRODUCING APPROXIMATELY 850,000 TONS ANNUALLY FROM AROUND 60,000 HECTARES OF FARMLAND. HOWEVER, DESPITE THIS GROWTH, POTATO CROPS REMAIN HIGHLY VULNERABLE TO VARIOUS DISEASES THAT CAN IMPACT BOTH THE PRE- AND POST-HARVEST STAGES, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING CROP QUALITY AND YIELD.
POTATO DISEASES, SUCH AS EARLY BLIGHT AND LATE BLIGHT, CAN CAUSE PREMATURE HARVESTS OR EVEN TOTAL CROP FAILURE IF NOT MANAGED EFFECTIVELY. THE PRIMARY ISSUE ARISES FROM THE DELAYED IDENTIFICATION AND INACCURATE DIAGNOSIS OF THESE DISEASES, WHICH ALLOWS THE PATHOGENS TO SPREAD UNCONTROLLABLY. FARMERS OFTEN RELY ON MANUAL OBSERVATION AND PERSONAL ASSUMPTIONS TO IDENTIFY DISEASES, A PROCESS THAT IS BOTH TIME-CONSUMING AND PRONE TO ERRORS. SINCE THE SYMPTOMS OF DIFFERENT DISEASES MAY APPEAR SIMILAR, IT IS DIFFICULT TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THEM AT A GLANCE. THIS LACK OF ACCURATE, TIMELY DISEASE IDENTIFICATION OFTEN LEADS TO THE APPLICATION OF INEFFECTIVE TREATMENTS, WHICH FURTHER EXACERBATES CROP DAMAGE. FARMERS MAY MISINTERPRET THE SEVERITY OF THE DISEASE, APPLYING EITHER TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE PESTICIDE, LEADING TO ADDITIONAL LOSSES.
TO ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGE, WE PROPOSE A FAST AND ACCURATE METHOD FOR IDENTIFYING AND CLASSIFYING POTATO LEAF DISEASES USING A DEEP LEARNING APPROACH. BY EMPLOYING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNS) SUCH AS VGG16 AND VGG19, THIS SYSTEM CAN AUTOMATICALLY DETECT AND CLASSIFY DISEASES FROM LEAF IMAGES. THESE CNN MODELS ARE PARTICULARLY WELL-SUITED FOR THIS TASK DUE TO THEIR ABILITY TO LEARN COMPLEX FEATURES FROM IMAGES. THE PROPOSED SOLUTION AIMS TO PROVIDE FARMERS WITH AN ACCESSIBLE, USER-FRIENDLY PLATFORM THAT OFFERS REAL-TIME ANALYSIS, ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS, AND EFFECTIVE DISEASE MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS, ULTIMATELY IMPROVING CROP HEALTH AND REDUCING ECONOMIC LOSSES.
