# Potato-Leaf-disease-Classification using CNN


Abstract :
              Potato is one of the most widely consumed staple foods globally, ranking as the fourth most important crop. The demand for potatoes has surged significantly, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, potato diseases pose a major threat to both the quality and quantity of yields. Late detection and improper classification of these diseases can lead to severe damage to the crop. Fortunately, many potato plant diseases can be identified early through visual inspection of the leaves. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based system for classifying four common types of potato leaf diseases. By leveraging the VGG16 and VGG19 convolutional neural network architectures, we achieve precise and reliable classification. Our model demonstrates an impressive average accuracy of 99.65%, showcasing the effectiveness of deep neural networks for disease detection in potato plants. This approach holds significant promise for improving crop monitoring and management practices in agriculture

              I.	INTRODUCTION  :
                                     FOOD SECURITY AND IMPROVED NUTRITION ARE CRITICAL CHALLENGES FACING THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR GLOBALLY. POTATOES, A STAPLE FOOD IN MANY COUNTRIES, PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN ADDRESSING THESE NEEDS DUE TO THEIR NUTRITIONAL RICHNESS. THEY ARE PARTICULARLY HIGH IN ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS SUCH AS VITAMINS C AND B6, POTASSIUM, MAGNESIUM, AND IRON. GLOBALLY, POTATOES RANK AS THE FOURTH MOST CONSUMED VEGETABLE CROP, WITH INDONESIA EMERGING AS ONE OF THE LARGEST POTATO PRODUCERS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. OVER THE PAST DECADE, INDONESIAâ€™S POTATO PRODUCTION HAS SEEN RAPID GROWTH, PRODUCING APPROXIMATELY 850,000 TONS ANNUALLY FROM AROUND 60,000 HECTARES OF FARMLAND. HOWEVER, DESPITE THIS GROWTH, POTATO CROPS REMAIN HIGHLY VULNERABLE TO VARIOUS DISEASES THAT CAN IMPACT BOTH THE PRE- AND POST-HARVEST STAGES, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING CROP QUALITY AND YIELD.POTATO DISEASES, SUCH AS EARLY BLIGHT AND LATE BLIGHT, CAN CAUSE PREMATURE HARVESTS OR EVEN TOTAL CROP FAILURE IF NOT MANAGED EFFECTIVELY. THE PRIMARY ISSUE ARISES FROM THE DELAYED IDENTIFICATION AND INACCURATE DIAGNOSIS OF THESE DISEASES, WHICH ALLOWS THE PATHOGENS TO SPREAD UNCONTROLLABLY. FARMERS OFTEN RELY ON MANUAL OBSERVATION AND PERSONAL ASSUMPTIONS TO IDENTIFY DISEASES, A PROCESS THAT IS BOTH TIME-CONSUMING AND PRONE TO ERRORS. SINCE THE SYMPTOMS OF DIFFERENT DISEASES MAY APPEAR SIMILAR, IT IS DIFFICULT TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THEM AT A GLANCE. THIS LACK OF ACCURATE, TIMELY DISEASE IDENTIFICATION OFTEN LEADS TO THE APPLICATION OF INEFFECTIVE TREATMENTS, WHICH FURTHER EXACERBATES CROP DAMAGE. FARMERS MAY MISINTERPRET THE SEVERITY OF THE DISEASE, APPLYING EITHER TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE PESTICIDE, LEADING TO ADDITIONAL LOSSES.TO ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGE, WE PROPOSE A FAST AND ACCURATE METHOD FOR IDENTIFYING AND CLASSIFYING POTATO LEAF DISEASES USING A DEEP LEARNING APPROACH. BY EMPLOYING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS (CNNS) SUCH AS VGG16 AND VGG19, THIS SYSTEM CAN AUTOMATICALLY DETECT AND CLASSIFY DISEASES FROM LEAF IMAGES. THESE CNN MODELS ARE PARTICULARLY WELL-SUITED FOR THIS TASK DUE TO THEIR ABILITY TO LEARN COMPLEX FEATURES FROM IMAGES. THE PROPOSED SOLUTION AIMS TO PROVIDE FARMERS WITH AN ACCESSIBLE, USER-FRIENDLY PLATFORM THAT OFFERS REAL-TIME ANALYSIS, ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS, AND EFFECTIVE DISEASE MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS, ULTIMATELY IMPROVING CROP HEALTH AND REDUCING ECONOMIC LOSSES.

                                     II.	PROBLEM STATEMENT : 
                                                                Farmers who grow potatoes often suffer significant financial losses each year due to various diseases that affect potato plants. Among these, Early Blight and Late Blight are the most common and damaging diseases. Early Blight is caused by a fungus, while Late Blight is triggered by specific microorganisms. Early detection and accurate identification of these diseases are crucial, as timely and appropriate treatments can save a substantial portion of the crop, preventing economic loss. Since treatments for Early Blight and Late Blight differ, correctly identifying the disease type is essential for effective intervention.To address this issue, we leverage deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to diagnose these diseases through image-based classification. The images are categorized into three classes: Potato Late Blight, Potato Early Blight, and Healthy Potato Leaf.The process involves several steps, including importing the necessary libraries, loading and visualizing the data, splitting the dataset into training and validation sets, pre-processing the images, building and training the CNN model, and finally, evaluating the model's performance. This approach helps farmers make informed decisions, reducing crop waste and mitigating economic losses.

                                      Conclusion:
                                                                                Ultimately, in contemporary agriculture, the use of machine learning and deep learning approaches to classify potato leaf diseases has become a transforming method. Many studies have shown how well these technologies enable quick and precise disease diagnosis including Early Blight, Late Blight, Bacterial Wilt, and powdery mildew. For example, Kumar et al. (2021) investigated deep learning techniques for both Early Blight and Late Blight, therefore highlighting the possibility for great diagnostic accuracy with sophisticated algorithms. Gupta et al. (2019) also concentrated on employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify Late Blight, hence stressing the capacity of these models to understand intricate patterns from picture data.Furthermore underlined by Li et al. (2020) on identifying bacterial wilt is the adaptability of deep learning solutions in tackling several plant diseases. By creating machine learning models especially for identifying Early Blight and Late Blight, Rahman et al. (2022) strengthened the relevance of timely disease identification in agricultural management and so helped this sector. By CNN, Wang and Zhu (2021) automated the identification of powdery mildew in potato leaves, therefore proving the power of machine learning to simplify disease surveillance procedures.Apart from these results, Tran et al. (2022) used transfer learning to improve early blight detection accuracy while Ahmed and Queshi (2021) used deep learning algorithms to identify Potato Virus Y. Further reflecting the trend toward automation in disease identification, Patel et al. (2020) have shown the efficiency of CNN techniques in classifying early blight. All things considered, the combination of machine learning methods offers a strong toolkit for improving crop health management. By allowing timely interventions that lower the dependency on chemical treatments, the continuous research in this field not only increases diagnostic accuracy but also helps to promote sustainable agriculture practices. These technologies have great potential to greatly increase the sustainability and output of potato farming as they develop, therefore guaranteeing food security for an increasing population.
